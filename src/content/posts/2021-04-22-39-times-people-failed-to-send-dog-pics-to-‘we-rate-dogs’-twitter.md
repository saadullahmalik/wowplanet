You know how these days people can rate everything - from customer service to stuff you buy online and even your looks or your pets' likeability. And as much as people love the man's best friends aka dogs, they are still being rated for their demeanor and cuteness daily. And we know where to find the most hilarious funny dog ratings ever.

We Rate Dogs is a Twitter account that does exactly what it says. It rates dogs. And their funny captions are just over the top. All you have to do is send them a serious or funny dog picture via direct message (or any dog come to think of it), and they'll give it a score from one to ten. The only problem is, some people seem to be sending them pictures of things that CLEARLY aren't dogs! Scroll down to see the dog memes that we are talking about. From Taiwanese Guide Walruses and East African Chalupa Seals to Iraqi Speed Kangaroos and Mongolian Grass Snakes, the list contains pretty much every animal you can think of...except dogs!

Now scroll down below for the funny dog jokes from We Rate Dogs; these funny jokes are sure to help you get through even the gloomiest of Mondays.
