Shadow the white German Shepherd has a heart that skips a beat every time she spots a “tiny critter”! So when her family took in a young baby Pygmy goat, Shadow was straight up mesmerized to see the adorable kid. She instantly took the frail helpless youngling under her wing to declare that she had adopted the little one!

In this video, we see Shadow caring for her goat daughter like she is one of her own puppies! Shadow is resting on the carpet and has the wee creature tucked in right beside her warm belly. The loving pooch is so giddy with happiness that she can barely hold back her smiles as she tends to her precious baby!

Overcome by her motherly instincts, Shadow licks and cleans her “daughter” at regular intervals and wags her bushy tail away like a super proud mama! As for the baby goat, she feels pampered and protected with her dutiful doggie mama, and won’t budge an inch from her “safe haven”. This video is a burst of joy!

 Being a miniature breed goat, it’s likely that this cute little baby will always be Shadow’s pint-sized child! With her gleaming eyes and non-stop grins, we can tell that this compassionate pooch has embraced motherhood with a soothing sense of fulfillment. Good luck raising your furry cutie, Shadow!
