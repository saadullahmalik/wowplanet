No doubt dogs are man’s best friends, yet who are canines’ dearest companions? Stuffed purple unicorns, clearly. A story about this wanderer 1-year-old pit bull named Sisu circulated around the web as of late. Sisu attempted to take a stuffed unicorn on different occasions from this Dollar General. The owners of the shop continued tossing him out, yet Sisu was consistently returned, ran directly to the stuffed toy aisle, and snatched a similar unicorn each time.

The owners of the store called animal control to take away the dog and when they came to bring Sisu with them, an official named Samantha Lane purchased the stuffed purple unicorn for the pupper. From that point forward, Sisu happily came with the officials.

The canine couldn’t be isolated from his toy and goes through consistently with it. The shelter laborers thinks that Sisu either had a comparative toy or his owner had one actually like that. After Sisu’s post became a web sensation, he and his #1 toy got adopted and discovered their permanent home.

In the post, they stated: This is the thing that happens when you break into the Dollar General reliably to take the purple unicorn that you made a case for however then animal control brings you to secure you for your B and E and burglary yet the official buys your thing for you and gets it with you.
